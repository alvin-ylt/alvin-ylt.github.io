  <h1>Biography</h1>

  <p>
    Hello there! I'm Alvin Tang.
    As an undergraduate student at the Australian National University (ANU),
    I'm currently reading Advanced Computing R&D.
    Since I've been fascinated by the extensive application of mathematical theories in
    computational technology, it has been my aspiration to devote my future to the field
    of computer science.
  </p>

  <h2>Education</h2>

  <p>
    Born and raised in Hong Kong, I completed secondary education with A Levels and HKDSE.
    The latter, as the local curriculum in the city, was taught at school.
    To further discover and consolidate my foundational mathematical knowledge,
    I self-studied A Levels, which covered extra content
    such as algorithms, statistical models and graph theory in the meantime.
    I'm currently residing in Canberra, Australia as a Year 1 undergraduate student.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Feb 2022 - Dec 2025 (Expected):
      <a href="https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2022/program/AACRD">
        Bachelor of Advanced Computing (Research and Development) (Honours)</a>
        at the Australian National University (ANU)</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Click <a href="/courses">here</a> for a list of courses I took / will be taking</li>
      </ul>

    <li>Jun 2021: International Advanced Levels (IAL)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>A*A*A* in Mathematics, Further Mathematics and Physics</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Jun 2021: Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Completed in parallel with IAL studies</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <h2>Internship Experience</h2>
  
  <p>
    While my current knowledge level in computer science and programming isn't quite adequate
    to make contributions in the industry,
    I believe it's the best choice to start developing skills and
    gain experience early.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the holiday between high school graduation and entry into university,
    I was filled with gratitude to have the opportunity to be a student intern at
    <a href="https://auralabs.com.hk">Aura Labs</a>, based at the Hong Kong Science Park.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Jul 2021 - Aug 2021: Student Intern at Aura Labs</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Streamlining of DevOps pipeline with Jenkins, Docker, Webmin & nginx reverse proxy</li>
      <li>Automation with Ansible</li>
      <li>Creation of tools with Node.js and npm</li>
      <li>Web development with Notion</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This experience has allowed me to realise the significance of learning from practical work.
    I reckon that both academic studies and theoretical knowledge are critical for the
    understanding of computer science.
    Practical work, however, is just as significant when it comes to getting familiar with
    the application of the knowledge in real-world situations and the industry.
  </p>

  <p>
    At this stage, my main objective in seeking internships is to earn experience
    from practical work and most importantly, to learn.
  </p>

  <h2>How I began?</h2>

  <p>
    When I was in secondary school,
    I began my journey to explore programming and networking technology with
    hobby projects (including this website!).
  </p>

  <p>
    The enhancement of web security with Cloudflare proxy, DNSSEC and HSTS especially
    intrigued me to learn about cyber security and its underlying mathematical principles.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started learning to create programs with Python,
    as it's renowned as an "intuitive" programming language for beginners.
    Though I wasn't aware of program efficiency, it helped me broaden my horizons
    to algorithms. Some of my first programs are showcased here.
    Later on, I also attempted to create a Telegram chatbot with its API and hosted
    it with Raspberry Pi.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the internship at Aura Labs, I also had the first glance of Node.js
    as I created tools to convert documentation formats with JavaScript.
    Meanwhile, I developed the concept of time complexity, DevOps deployment and
    frontend/backend development.
  </p>

  <p>
    In fact, I did not learn programming formally until the first semester
    at university, where we work on more extensive projects with Haskell.
    One of the projects was to develop software agents to play a board game.
    The declarative programming language resembles mathematical functions and
    is much more type-sensitive than Python.
    This brought my attention to type theory and its relationship with
    high-level programming languages.
  </p>

  <h2>Future Plans?</h2>

  <p>
    Upon establishing sufficient foundational knowledge in computing,
    I might choose to specialise in AI or systems & architecture.
    Research projects in Year 3-4 will help me decide whether, upon graduation,
    academic research will suit me the best.
    Research in computational theory may be considered a pathway to academia.
    Alternatively, I may pursue my career in software development.
  </p>


  <h2>Hobbies</h2>

  <p>
    In addition to my great passion for mathematics and computing,
    I love visiting historical sites and museums
    during holidays. There's nothing more relaxing and enjoyable than
    cycling around the city and appreciating
    the beautiful scenery in Canberra.
